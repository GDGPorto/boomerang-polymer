## WARNING
This branch is based on an old version of Polymer and has not been
updated to support recent versions (such as 0.9.0 as of 2015-05-27).
It is currently unlikely to work out of the box.

## About

Based on the GDG Twin Cities site (http://dev.gdgtc.com/gdgtc-site-polymer), this page is a polymer implementation of 
boomerang, the templates for GDG chapters.
